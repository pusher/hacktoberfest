# Pusher Hacktoberfest Contributor Guide 🎃

Hacktoberfest 2022 is finally here, and we're pretty excited about it. Open source developers also play a crucial role in making our API's accessible and compatible with different ecosystems. We think it's a great time to encourage, recognise and reward developers in the community who dedicate their time to creating for others.

## What is Hacktoberfest?
Hacktoberfest is an annual festival hosted by DigitalOcean that takes place in the month of October to celebrate the open source community. As part of this 31-day celebration, contributors and open source maintainers are encouraged to work on open source projects and win swag to mark the occasion. 

## About Pusher
Pusher provides bi-directional hosted realtime APIs that are flexible, scalable and easy to use. We create and maintain complex messaging infrastructure so you can build the features your users need, fast.

With our API’s you can build anything that requires realtime functionality including chat, gaming, charts, location tracking, presence indicators and [more](https://pusher.com/channels/use-cases).

## Tips for contributors
- PRs beyond our open issues are welcome but make sure your contributions are meaningful and beneficial to other users otherwise your PR may be closed and marked as ‘invalid’.
- Issues before PRs. If you plan to make a contribution, please make sure there is an issue for it. You can either find an existing issue or open a new issue if none exists.
- Have a read of the Pusher community [code of conduct](https://pusher.com/code-of-conduct) to help us maintain a safe and inclusive environment for the community and Pusher team 


## Ready to make a contribution? 
If you’re working on an open issue, read the CONTRIBUTING.MD file in the repo to get specific guidelines on how to work on that repo. Ask to be assigned to that issue before you start working on it.

If you’re building a demo app, writing a tutorial or blog post, fork the README.MD file in the pusher/hacktoberfest repo and make PR with a link to what you’ve worked on and an email address we can reach out to you to claim your swag on.

You will receive a review, comment, and approval by a member of the Pusher team within a couple of days. All PRs accepted by the team will be marked as ‘hacktoberfest-accepted’ by October 31st.
